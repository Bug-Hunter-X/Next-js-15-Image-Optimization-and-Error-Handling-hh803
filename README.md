# Next.js 15 Image Optimization and Error Handling
This repo demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15 applications involving image optimization and error handling.  Specifically, we'll look at how to gracefully handle missing images during the build process and at runtime.

## The Problem
The `about.js` file attempts to render an image using `src='/missing.png'`. If this image file does not exist, Next.js will throw an error, halting the build process or causing a runtime error.

## The Solution
The solution involves implementing robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle missing images, for example, by using a placeholder image or preventing the image from rendering entirely.
